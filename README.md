# Analytics for community teams 
**This is a collaborative project to help community teams be better at recording the impact of their activities and communicating emperical results to their teams and others througout the organization.**

It's pretty easy to "just know" that your community-building efforts have a positive impact on your business. But intution must be accompanied by dependable, relevant data in order to tell a cohesive story. The outcomes of [developer evangelism](https://sendgrid.com/blog/explained-developer-evangelism-parents/) (for example) are difficult to capture, quantify, and communicate to others.

So, we aim to overcome the challenges by building a solution that fits the strategy of our community team at [Keen IO](http://keen.io) and reports on the analytics that matter most to us. Our vision is something that can collect data from various sources, anaylyze that data to uncover answers to meaningful questions, and visualize those answers to the audiences who care. 

We're going to build this out in the open, and we invite everyone and anyone to join us in the journey. We want this to be useful to as many people and in as many ways as possible. 

Watch this repo for updates and progress, create an issue and/or submit a pull request to contribute, fork some code and build a solution that meets your team's unique needs (and tell us all about it!), send us feedback and/or questions to spark conversations, or just be inspired to go build something of your own, be it from scratch or a peacemeal of other existing tools.

###Potential sources from which one might pull, during the **data** ***collection*** process: 

* Custom data streams: examples? --> could be data from your application - like signups, logins, etc
* Social: mentions, interactions/engagements, impressions, etc: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube ...
* Payment processing: Stripe, Paypal, Dwolla ...
* Customer engagement tools: HubSpot, Intercom ...
* Email events: opens, clicks, unsubscribes, spam reports, etc. /& don't forget inbound email! 
* RSVPs/Registrations: Eventbrite, Meetup.com, Splash, EventJoy ...
* Forum activity: StackOverflow, Discourse, Google Groups ...
* Keen IO event data (anything you want to send to Keen for storage, analysis, visualization)

### Metrics that matter...or do they?
* New signups (free or paid)
* Upgrades, conversions from free to paid, or paid to paying more
  * Revenue related to signups/upgrades
*  Github stars, forks, issues, commits, merges, PRs, etc (per repo and org total)
*  SDK installs: via - npm, NuGet, pip, Maven ...
  *  % of users/customers using SDKs and revenue related to those customers (per SDK and org total)
*  Slack stats: members active, members inactive, members deactivated, new members joined ...
*  Social sentiment: do they love us or hate us or not care about us?
*  Top web traffic and conversion sources: internal *and* external referral sources - eg, blog posts, docs, Github repos, press/news/articles)
*  T-shirts gifted (in person and/or by mail)
*  # of highs-fived
*  Diversity of community -- demographic breakdown
*  Engagement type -- broadcast vs conversation

### Dreamy stats: If you could measure anything, what would it be?
*  quantify the likelihood of a community member signing up vs a *non*-community member
*  cost savings correlated to community members helping each other in forums, Slack, etc (aka, deflected support costs)
