# community-dashboard
This is a collaborative project to help community managers be better at recording the impact of their activities and communicating the results.

It's pretty easy to "just know" that your community-building efforts have a positive impact on your business. But intution needs dependable data to accompany it in narrating a cohesive story. The outcomes of developer evangelism (for example) are difficult to capture, quantify, and communicate to others. 

So, we're gonna try to overcome those challenges and build a solution that meets the needs of the community team at Keen IO. Something that can collect data from various sources, anaylyze that data to uncover answers to meaningful questions, and visualize those answers to the audiences who care. 

We're going to build this out in the open, and we invite everyone and anyone to join us in the journey. Watch our repo for updates and progress, fork the codebase to build your own solution that meets your team's unique needs, or just be inspired to go build something of your own, be it from scratch or a peacemeal of other existing tools.
