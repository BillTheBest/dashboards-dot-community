# community-dashboard
**This is a collaborative project to help community teams be better at recording the impact of their activities and communicating emperical results to their teams and others througout the organization.**

It's pretty easy to "just know" that your community-building efforts have a positive impact on your business. But intution must be accompanied by dependable, relevant data in order to tell a cohesive story. The outcomes of [developer evangelism](https://sendgrid.com/blog/explained-developer-evangelism-parents/) (for example) are difficult to capture, quantify, and communicate to others.

So, we aim to overcome the challenges by building a solution that fits the strategy of our community team at [Keen IO](http://keen.io) and reports on the analytics that matter most to us. Our vision is something that can collect data from various sources, anaylyze that data to uncover answers to meaningful questions, and visualize those answers to the audiences who care. 

We're going to build this out in the open, and we invite everyone and anyone to join us in the journey. We want this to be useful to as many people and in as many ways as possible. 

Watch our repo for updates and progress, fork the codebase to build your own solution that meets your team's unique needs, send us feedback and/or questions to spark conversations, or just be inspired to go build something of your own, be it from scratch or a peacemeal of other existing tools. 

Oh yeah, also...[INTERNET HIGH FIVE!](http://keen.github.io/highfive/)
